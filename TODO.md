# filtersnatch - to-do list

UI (still kinda core):

- allow pause/resume (also from tray)
- show current status (pending dirs, pending modes, watching, paused)
- show last filter replacement action

deployment:

- add build tags
- add build & release packaging scripts
- add github actions build workflow

QA:

- md5 matching on source and dest files?

marketing:

- github page
- demo video?

nice to have:

- toggle: attempt to delete downloaded filter after successful overwrite
- transparency toggle
- actions taken log
